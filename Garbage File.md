Garbage File
============

or, how I stopped worrying and learned to take out the trash.

Where Trash Goes
----------------

Paper goes in the blue bin labelled "paper". Hard plastic and bottles should be drained, rinsed, and carefully placed
in the other blue bin. Ordinary trash goes in the large black bin (which should always, always have a bag in it).

Broken glass should be wrapped in paper before being tossed. If the trash bin is full (almost filled to the brim), 
the current bag should be taken out, tied shut, and placed in front of the elevator.

Empty trash bags are on the floor under the kitchen shelves with the dishes and cutlery.

Liquids and semi-liquids should always be drained before disposal.

Cardboard boxes are broken down and placed between the trash bin and the vending machine.

Getting Trash Ready for Pick-up
-------------------------------

* Put on obnoxious, peppy music
* Check the trash bins in the bathroom, tool town, laser room, and back room
* Bag ordinary trash in black bags
* Recycling goes in clear blue bags
* Don't overload bags!
* Use the freight elevator to bring down the trash
* Halt obnoxious, peppy music

Ordinary Trash Pickup and Paper/Plastic/Bottle Recycling
--------------------------------------------------------

We have a contract with Viking Sanitation; they pick up the trash once a week on Tuesday nights. Ideally, our trash
should be out on the curb by 9pm. Please put the trash on the loading dock in front at the edge of the dock; that way
the trash collectors can get at it easily without having to climb the dock and we don't block the sidewalk.

Ordinary trash goes in the large plastic bags. Laser scraps and lumber scraps should be double-bagged.

Propane and Other Compressed Gas Cylinders
------------------------------------------

These can be safely disposed of at the Lowe's on 9th Street. Until then they should be placed, empty, in front of
the trash bin. If you see tanks there and you're on your way to that neighborhood, please grab 'em!

E-Waste
-------

Place useful e-waste in the large rubber bin labelled "e-waste". These will be taken semi-regularly to the e-waste
depot run by the Lower East Side Ecology Project off Third Avenue south of Union St. (look up address). If you see a
full bin and have a car/handtruck and want to do a run, go for it! Just bring back the bin!
